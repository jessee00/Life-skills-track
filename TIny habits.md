# Tiny Habits
## 1. Your takeaways from the video.

- Start with a small and achievable habit: Fogg suggests starting with a habit that is so small that it's almost laughably easy, such as doing two push-ups or flossing just one tooth. By starting with a small habit, you can build momentum and create a foundation for larger changes in the future.

- Celebrate your successes: Every time you successfully complete your tiny habit, take a moment to celebrate and feel good about yourself. Celebrating your success can help you stay motivated and build confidence in your ability to make changes.

- Anchor your new habit to an existing behavior: To make it easier to remember to do your new habit, Fogg recommends anchoring it to an existing behavior. For example, if you want to start doing squats every day, you could anchor the habit to brushing your teeth by doing squats immediately after brushing.

- Focus on consistency over intensity: Fogg suggests that it's more important to do your habit consistently, even if it's just for a few seconds each day, than it is to do it intensely but irregularly. Consistency builds momentum and creates a habit that becomes automatic over time.

- Build on your success: Once you've established a tiny habit, you can gradually build on it to make it more challenging. For example, if you started with two push-ups

## 2. Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible.
- Tiny habits are small, easy-to-do actions that we can integrate into our daily routines. These habits can take as little as 30 seconds to complete, and they should be so easy that we can do them even on our busiest days.

- We can create new habits by identifying "anchor moments" in our day - times when we are already doing something that could serve as a cue for a new behavior. For example, if we always brush our teeth after we shower in the morning, we could use that as an anchor moment to add a new habit like doing five pushups.

- When creating new habits, it's important to start small and gradually increase the difficulty over time. BJ Fogg recommends starting with a habit that is so easy it seems almost ridiculous, like doing one pushup or flossing just one tooth. Once we've successfully integrated that habit into our routine, we can increase the difficulty and do more.

- Celebrating our successes is crucial to making new habits stick. BJ Fogg recommends giving ourselves a small reward, like saying "good job!" or doing a fist pump, after we complete our new habit. This positive reinforcement can help us feel more motivated to continue with the habit.

- Finally, BJ Fogg emphasizes that the key to creating lasting behavior change is to focus on building positive emotions around the new habit. If we associate our new habit with feelings of joy, satisfaction, or pride, we are more likely to stick with it over time.

## 3. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?
- B = MAP is an acronym that stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. It's a framework used to explain and predict behavior and can also be used to make forming new habits easier. Here's how you can use B = MAP to create new habits:

- Behavior: Identify the behavior you want to create a habit around. Be specific about what you want to do, when you want to do it, and how often.

- Motivation: Increase your motivation by making the behavior more appealing. Find a way to connect the behavior with something you already enjoy, or make it more rewarding. You could also try visualizing the benefits of the behavior or creating a personal mantra to keep yourself motivated.

- Ability: Make it easier to perform the behavior by removing obstacles and creating a supportive environment. Simplify the behavior by breaking it down into smaller steps and removing any unnecessary steps. Set up reminders and cues that will prompt you to perform the behavior.

- Prompt: Use prompts to trigger the behavior. This could be a reminder on your phone or a note on your fridge. Make sure the prompt is visible and easy to see, so you don't forget.

- By applying the B = MAP framework to create new habits, you can increase your chances of success. By breaking down the behavior into its component parts and addressing motivation, ability, and prompts, you can make the behavior more achievable and increase your chances of making it a habit.

## 4. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

- Celebrating or "shining" after each successful completion of a habit is important for several reasons:

- Positive reinforcement: Celebrating your success provides positive reinforcement for the behavior you want to make a habit. Positive reinforcement is a powerful motivator that can help you stick to your habit over the long term.

- Increased motivation: Celebrating your success can also increase your motivation to continue with the habit. When you feel good about what you've accomplished, you're more likely to want to keep going.

- Boosted self-confidence: Celebrating your success can boost your self-confidence and make you feel more capable of achieving your goals. This can lead to a snowball effect where you feel more motivated and empowered to take on other challenges in your life.

- Enhanced well-being: Celebrating your success can also enhance your well-being by boosting your mood and reducing stress. When you feel good about yourself, you're more likely to have a positive outlook and be more resilient in the face of challenges.

## 5. Your takeaways from the video.
- The main takeaway from James Clear's "1% Better Every Day" talk at ConvertKit Craft + Commerce 2017 is that small, consistent improvements can lead to significant progress over time. Clear emphasizes the importance of focusing on the process rather than the outcome, and using small wins to build momentum and create positive habits.

- He suggests breaking down larger goals into smaller, actionable steps, and committing to making incremental improvements each day. By consistently focusing on small improvements, we can create positive habits that compound over time and lead to significant progress.

- Clear also stresses the importance of tracking progress and using feedback loops to make adjustments and continue improving. He suggests using a system of continuous improvement, where we regularly evaluate our progress, identify areas for improvement, and adjust our approach accordingly.

- Overall, the message of Clear's talk is that small, consistent improvements can lead to significant progress and transformation over time. By focusing on the process, tracking progress, and using feedback loops to make adjustments, we can achieve our goals and create positive habits that last.

## 6. Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?

"Atomic Habits" by James Clear provides a comprehensive framework for developing and sustaining productive habits. Clear's perspective on habit formation revolves around three key elements: identity, processes, and outcomes.

Identity: Clear believes that habits are fundamentally linked to our identities. In other words, we develop habits that reflect who we believe ourselves to be. Therefore, to create lasting changes in our habits, we must first focus on transforming our self-image. Clear argues that we should shift our focus from setting goals to developing a strong identity as a person who embodies the desired behavior. For instance, instead of setting a goal to lose weight, we should focus on becoming someone who values healthy living.

Processes: According to Clear, processes are the key to habit formation. He advocates for breaking down our habits into small, manageable tasks and creating a system for executing them consistently. Clear refers to this process as "habit stacking" - linking new habits to existing ones to make them easier to incorporate into our daily routine. He emphasizes that consistent execution of the process, even in small increments, is more important than focusing on the outcome.

Outcomes: While outcomes are essential, Clear argues that they should not be the primary focus of habit formation. Instead, he suggests that we should focus on developing an effective process, and the outcomes will naturally follow. Clear emphasizes that outcomes are a byproduct of the daily habits we form, and we must stay focused on the process to achieve our desired results.

In conclusion, "Atomic Habits" provides a fresh perspective on habit formation by highlighting the importance of identity, processes, and outcomes. Clear's approach emphasizes the significance of a strong self-image and the importance of creating a system of consistent small actions to achieve lasting changes in behavior. The book's practical advice and examples provide readers with a clear path to developing and sustaining productive habits.

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier?

- "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. The book provides a comprehensive framework for developing and maintaining positive habits, based on the idea that small changes can have a significant impact over time.

- One of the core principles of the book is the concept of "habit stacking." This involves adding a new habit onto an existing one, so that the two become linked in the mind. For example, if you want to start meditating every morning, you could link this habit to your existing habit of making a cup of coffee. This could involve meditating for five minutes while your coffee brews, so that the two activities become intertwined in your daily routine.

- Another key principle of "Atomic Habits" is the importance of making good habits convenient and easy to perform. Clear argues that we are more likely to stick to habits that require minimal effort and that fit easily into our existing routines. To make a habit more convenient, you could set up a dedicated space for it, or invest in tools or equipment that make it easier to perform. For example, if you want to start doing push-ups every morning, you could set up a mat and a timer in a designated corner of your bedroom, so that you have everything you need in one place.

Overall, "Atomic Habits" provides a practical and actionable guide to developing good habits that stick. By focusing on small changes and making habits easy to perform, the book offers a realistic approach to habit formation that can be applied to any area of life.

## 8. Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?

- One of the key strategies for making bad habits more difficult is to increase the friction associated with the behavior. This involves adding obstacles or barriers to the habit, making it more challenging to perform. For example, if you want to break the habit of mindlessly scrolling through social media before bed, you could make it more difficult by deleting social media apps from your phone or charging your phone outside of your bedroom.

- Clear also suggests changing the environment or context in which the habit occurs. This can involve removing cues or triggers that lead to the behavior, or creating new cues that promote positive habits. For example, if you want to break the habit of snacking on junk food while watching TV, you could remove unhealthy snacks from your home or switch to a different room where you don't associate with eating.

- Another strategy for making bad habits more difficult is to use accountability. This can involve telling a friend or family member about your goal, or joining a group or program that holds you accountable for your behavior. By adding an external source of motivation, you are more likely to stick to your new habits.

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
- I want to make the habit of eating healthier. The steps I am to take are:

- Will Plan meals in advance and set specific meal times to avoid unhealthy snacking or fast food.

- Will try experimenting with new healthy recipes and cooking techniques that appeal to your taste buds. Incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet or make healthier versions of your favorite meals.

Will start small by making small changes to your diet, such as drinking water instead of sugary drinks or choosing whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates. Make healthy eating more convenient by meal prepping or keeping healthy snacks on hand.

## 10. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

- Here, I want to reduce your habit of watching TV for several hours every day.

- Can make the cue invisible by putting the remote control out of sight and unplugging the TV when it's not in use. By making it less visible and accessible, I will be less likely to turn on the TV.

To make the process unattractive or hard, I could create barriers that make it more difficult to watch TV. For example, I could move the TV to a different room, cancel my cable subscription, or only allow myself to watch TV after completing a task or activity that I have been putting off.

To make the response unsatisfying, I could replace TV watching with a more fulfilling and rewarding activity. For example, I could start a new hobby, exercise, or spend more time with friends and family. I could also track my progress and set goals for myself to help me stay motivated.

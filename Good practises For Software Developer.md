## 1. What is your one major takeaway from each one of the 6 sections. So 6 points in total.

- Gathering requirements: Take detailed notes during meetings, share them with the team, and get frequent feedback during implementation to ensure everyone is on the same page.
- Always over-communicate: Use group chats, keep your video on during meetings, and inform relevant team members about any changes or unexpected issues.
- Stuck? Ask questions: Explain the problem clearly, provide details on what you've tried, and use tools like screenshots, diagrams, and code snippets to help others understand the issue.
- Get to know your teammates: Take time to build relationships with your team members, join meetings early to chat, and schedule calls when it's convenient for everyone.
- Be aware and mindful of other team members: Consolidate your questions into a single message, be available for real-time conversations, and choose communication mediums wisely.
- Doing things with 100% involvement: Practice deep work, eliminate distractions, track your time, manage your food and exercise, and treat remote work as seriously as in-person work.

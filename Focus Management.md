# Focus Management

## 1. What is Deep Work?
 Cal Newport, a computer science professor and author, and Lex Fridman, an AI researcher and podcaster, discuss the concept of "deep work". Deep work refers to the ability to focus deeply on a cognitively demanding task without distractions, and is increasingly important in today's world where distractions are ubiquitous.

Newport explains that deep work is valuable because it allows individuals to produce high-quality work that is rare and valuable in today's knowledge economy. He argues that deep work is becoming increasingly rare as people spend more time on shallow work, such as checking emails and social media.
